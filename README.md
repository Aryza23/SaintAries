## A Powerful and Modular

Zero Two is a powerful and modular telegram group management bot built using python3 and sqlalchemy. Literally she can do anything to help you make your group a better place like any other bot and she's painted with anime theme for weeb lover's.

## NOTE:

  I'm making this note to whoever comes to see this repo. (I came through a lot to make this bot) - I would not say such dumb thing like this, the whole credits goes to [SaitamaRobot](https://github.com/AnimeKaizoku/SaitamaRobot). You might ask me what you did?, well i did some edits with my knowledge to make this bot like my own. I don't give a shit about any illegal problems if anyone comes with that GPLv3 license stuff. After all i came through a lot from many developers, No one ever told me/us anything not even a simple guide. So i will make this repo public so anyone can learn or get code from here for my future updates.
