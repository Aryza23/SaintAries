MARKDOWN_HELP = """
You can use markdown to make your messages more expressive. This is the markdown currently supported:

<code>`code words`</code> backticks allow you to wrap your words in monospace fonts. Shows as: <code>code words</code>
<code>*bold words*</code> asterixes are used for bold font. Shows as: <b>bold words</b>
<code>_italic words_</code> underscores are used for italics. Shows as: <i>italic words</i>
<code>[hyperlink](example.com)</code> this is used for <code>[hyperlink](http://example.com/)</code>, and will show as such: hyperlink. Make sure not to add any extra spaces between the ] and the ( or it won't be valid markdown.

Now, if you wanted to have buttons on your message, you could use this special syntax:
<code>[button](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
This will create a button named "button" which redirects the user to example.com upon clicking.
If you would like to add two buttons on the same row, add :same at the end of your link; it'll set it on the same line as the other one. For example:
<code>[button](buttonurl://example.com)
[button 2](buttonurl://example.com:same)
[button 3](buttonurl://example.com)</code>
will create two buttons on the same line (buttons 1 and 2), and a last one (button 3) on a second line.

Fillings:
You can also use certain tags to fill your message with user or chat info; the options are:
<code>{first}</code>: The user's first name.
<code>{last}</code>: The user's last name.
<code>{fullname}</code>: The user's full name.
<code>{username}</code>: The user's username; if none is available, mentions the user.
<code>{mention}</code>: Mentions the user, using their firstname.
<code>{id}</code>: The user's id.
<code>{chatname}</code>: The chat's name.
<code>{rules}</code>: Adds a link to the chat's rules.
<code>{preview}</code>: Enables link previews for this message. Can be useful when using links to Instant View pages.

An example of how to use fillings would be to set your welcome, via:
<code>/setwelcome Hey there {first}! Welcome to {chatname}.</code>

Try these out on notes, filters, welcome messages or even rules!
